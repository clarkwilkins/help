		<div class = "flexCol flexCol3">When a credit memo posts, it creates a transaction transferring the memo amount from a sales income account to this account &#8212; pending a refund or reapplication of the funds against another balance due.

		<div class = "flexCol flexCol3">When an employee's payroll is processed, the employer typically pays a matching tax contribution for FICA and Medicare expenses (and possibly other taxes). These costs are tax-deductible expenses, and as such are to be grouped in a non-overhead expense account.</div>

<p>You can run <strong>accountd</strong> without these settings. However, certain reporting functions, such as credit memo analysis, won't be able to function unless these accounts are designated.</p>
