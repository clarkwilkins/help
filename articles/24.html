<p>Each time you are invited to a topic, you receive an invite that includes a reference to the person who invited you. In the text is a link to the blocking page which will install a record that prevents that user from issuing you any further invitations. The block is based on your email and phone number.</p>

<div class = "block">Permanent blocks are available on request</div>

<p>You can delete your <tt>topical</tt> account from here, but this has the disadvantage of removing the blocking record. If you need a permanent block, send an email to simplexable.com and specify the email of the person you want us to block from contacting you again. We will handle it as soon as we receive and process your information.</p>
