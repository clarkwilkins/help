<p>The global followups manager works identically in all supported platforms.<sup>1</sup> All open followups connected to your group are available here, but only followups for the current platform you are on will be open by default.<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>At the top of each platform's followup list are the controls <tt>+show</tt> and <tt>-hide</tt> to show and hide respectively the platform's list details.</p>

<p>The items are listed in date order with overdue items showing red dates, and current (today) items showing blue dates. If notes are available or the followup is assigned, you will see this additional information in the list.<sup>3</sup> Clicking on any item takes you to the item details in the selected platform.<sup>4</sup>

		<li>Nothing is open by default if your current platform has no followups.</li>
		<li>These aspects are managed in the followups interface. Notes are especially recommended, because they can provide context at a glance &#8212; without having to &#8220;drill down&#8221; into the item details.</li>
