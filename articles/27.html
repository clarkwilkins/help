<p>Search in <tt>topical</tt> uses case-insensitive wildcard matching &#8212; by which we mean a search for &#8220;test&#8221; returns matches for &#8220;test&#8221;, &#8220;TEST&#8221;, &#8220;at<u>test</u>&#8221;, &#8220;<u>test</u>ed&#8221;, etc.</p>

<p>Searches are made separately for discussions where the string appears in the title and searches where the string appears in a comment in the discussion. Your results are limited to discussions where you have access either as the owner or as a participant.</p>

<p>Any results found are shown as direct links to the discussion(s) involved.</p>
