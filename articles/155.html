<p>There are two purposes for this report: to show you all customer credit memos, and to show you how credits are handled, and where the credits go. The report is accessible at <strong>analysis:credit memo usage</strong>.</p>

<p>Each customer account which has at least one credit memo is shown.<sup>1</sup> The results are sorted by date to show three types of actions, and their effect on the client's available credit balance.</p>

<p>First, it shows any credit memos posted on the day.<sup>2</sup> These <u>increase</u> the credit balance.</p>

<p>Second, it shows any customer refunds issued.<sup>3</sup> These <u>decrease</u> the credit balance.</p>

<p>Third, it shows any credit that was applied to an invoice balance on this day.<sup>4</sup> These also <u>decrease</u> the credit balance.</p>
