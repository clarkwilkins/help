<p>The search engine for parts requests shows the last 48 hours of requests by default. You can initiate searches by a specific customer and/or part number to look at broader trends. All results can be clicked on to bring the details up in the editor view. You may find the request history is a useful metric of market interest in a given SKU &#8212; which, in turn, may influence your purchasing decisions.</p>
