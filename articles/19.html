<p>There are only two requirements for setting up a topic: the title and the first comment. If you create the topic at this point, you are the only participant.</p>

<p>It's more common that you want to go ahead and define one or more others that will be &#8220;invited&#8221; into the discussion. To set up these pending &#8220;participants&#8221;, click on the top line that reads &#8220;Click here to add more...&#8221;</p>

<div class = "block">adding new contacts</div>

<p>If you are not yet connected to anyone in <tt>topical</tt>, you will automatically be shown the new contact section. Otherwise, you use <tt>+add someone</tt> to open it.</p>

<p>The fields for adding a new contact are:</p>

<div class = "results">

	<div class = "reportLine flexBox">
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol1">name<sup>1</sup></div>
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol3">The name of the person you are inviting.</div>
	
	</div>

	<div class = "reportLine flexBox">
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol1">email<sup>1</sup></div>
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol3">The email address of the person you are inviting.</div>
	
	</div>

	<div class = "reportLine flexBox">
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol1">mobile/SMS<sup>1</sup></div>
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol3">The number of the person you are inviting.</div>
	
	</div>

	<div class = "reportLine flexBox">
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol1">message</div>
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol3">An optional message to be included in the invitation message.</div>
	
	</div>
	
</div>

<p>Once you save the contact, they show up on the pending list &#8212; meaning they will be added <u>when</u> you create the topic.</p>

<div class = "block">adding existing contacts</div>

<p>Once you have one or more existing contacts, they are shown by default and can be selected with a click.</p>

<div class = "block">removing pending contacts</div>

<p>Any pending contact can be removed by clicking on them in the list.</p>

<div class = "block">topic creation</div>

<p>When creating the topic, the following steps happen:</p>

<ol>
	<li>The topic is created.</li>
	<li>Your first comment is added.</li>
	<li>Each participant is evaluated. If the contact is in <tt>topical</tt>, their account is created.</li>
	<li>Each participant gets an invite message to the topic.<sup>2</sup></li>
</ol>
