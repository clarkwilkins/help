<p>Simplexable operates three platforms<sup>1</sup> that can share customer and user resources. This means you manage these records in a single &#8220;global&#8221; tool, and any changes you make are available to all three platforms. The data is extensible and shared as set by the &#8220;grant access&#8221; options. If you change a client from one platform, it's also changed for any others that use the client.</p>

<div class = "block"><b>Companies act as containers</b></div>

<p>In <tt>servicd</tt> and <tt>stockd</tt>, you are running a single company. Your accounts can be shared within all three platforms, but <tt>servicd</tt> and <tt>stockd</tt> can only share customers within the same company ID. The <tt>accountd</tt> software, on the other hand, can manage the accounting for N > 1 companies at the same time, so it can access any client in any company designated in your group.<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>Client records can store unlimited information in one of four sections.</p>

	<ol>
		<li><tt>servicd</tt> for service job management, <tt>stockd</tt> for warehouse/parts management, and <tt>accountd</tt> for multi-company accounting.</li>
		<li>Here's a real-world example. Simplexable runs <tt>servicd</tt> and <tt>accountd</tt> for our software operations. We run <tt>stockd</tt> and <tt>accountd</tt> for our parts sales operations. These are two separate companies, and they do not share clients between companies, but they do share them between platforms. The <tt>accountd</tt> software needs to be able to see clients from the company it's currently working in, so it can do things like search for invoices by customer, or print statements.</li>
		<li>At this time, there's no functional difference between suspended and inactive. These clients cannot be used in new transactions.</li>
		<li>All clients are accessible within a company ID (<tt>servicd</tt>, <tt>stockd</tt>) or an entities group (<tt>accountd</tt>) if this is checked. However, a user with access to manage clients can still see these groups within customer management, because this tool exists above the individual platforms.</li>
