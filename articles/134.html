<p><strong>servicd</strong>, by design, does not attempt to provide inventory management. That said, it does afford the concept of attaching N arbitrary items to the job ticket.

<p>Each item has three fields:</p>

<div class = "results">

	<div class = "flexBox reportLine">
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol1">item</div>
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol3">A reference ID that makes sense in your own tracking systems.</div>
		
	</div>

	<div class = "flexBox reportLine">
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol1">notes</div>
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol3">A description of the item being attached.</div>
	
	</div>

	<div class = "flexBox reportLine">
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol1">cost</div>
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol3">An associated cost.</div>
	
	</div>
	
</div>


<p>You can add new items to the ticket with <tt>+item</tt>.</p>
