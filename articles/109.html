<p>The setup area is where you choose the user and the settings you want to configure. Users here are considered active/inactive in a global context.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>The first option is basic user configuration as discussed <a href = "?h=107">here</a>.</p>

<p>After that, a service option is shown for each registered company and all <a href = "?h=107">available services</a>. You can leave a user/service area unconfigured if you are not using it or the user does not need access. You can also go into a particular service to configure the user-specific settings.</p>

<div class = "tiny">

	<ol>
		<li>A user is defined <a href = "?h=108">globally</a> as a part of your group. This being a global-scope tool, the results are filtered on whether the user is active overall &#8212; not whether they are active in <u>this</u> platform, for <u>this</u> company. That's a filtering distinction that's relevant in the platform, but not here in the global editor.</li>
