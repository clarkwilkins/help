<p>Followups are scheduled reminders to come back to a job ticket or a task. You can set them from the <a href = "?h=128">ticket update view</a> or the task view.</p>

<p>In addition to the date, you can also assign a followup to a specific user. When you open <strong>followups due</strong> on the <strong>&#9776;</strong> menu, there are two numbers (X/Y). X is the number of followups due today. Y is the number of followups that are <u>overdue</u>. Your count and list will not contain any followups assigned to another user.</p>
