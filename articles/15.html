<p>The general search on the top menu bar is inherently limited in scope of search. For purposes of analyis, this tool offers a far more comprehensive set of search options. All filter controls here trigger a search change as they are modified. The default search result is all expenses in the last month.</p>

<blockquote><b>Remember these filters work together and only return results matching all filters.</b></blockquote>
