<div class = "block p3">removing users from a topic</div>

<p>The topic owner is the only one who can remove other users from a topic. When triggered, this function also removes all of the user's comments in the topic per our <a href = "?h=22">ownership policy</a>.

<div class = "block">adding new users to a topic</div>

<p>The topic owner is the <u>only</u> person who can invite others to the topic. <tt>topical</tt> will look first for users you are already connected to and list any of them who are not on this topic. You can click on any name found and add them.</p>

<p>The inputs for a new user are:</p>

<div class = "results">

	<div class = "reportLine flexBox">
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol1">name</div>
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol3">the targeted contact's name</div>
	
	</div>

	<div class = "reportLine flexBox">
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol1">email</div>
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol3">the targeted contact's email</div>

		<div class = "flexCol flexCol1">SMS/mobile<sup>3</sup></div>
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol3">the targeted contact's phone</div>
	
	</div>

</div>

<p>When an invite is sent, if the email/mobile pair is found in the user list for <tt>topical</tt>, the existing user is paired and linked to the discussion.<sup>4</sup> Otherwise a new user record is created and paired.</p>

<div class = "block">participant settings</div>

<p>Participants are limited to putting discussion-specific settings in place that override their default (account-wide) settings.</p>

<p>The participant can customize alert settings for this topic, and can remove themselves from the participants.<sup>5</sup></p>
