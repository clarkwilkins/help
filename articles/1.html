	<div>NOTES</div>
	
	<ol>
		<li>If a transaction exists with this ID number, but itâ€™s not a journal entry, it will not be shown. You can do a more comprehensive search using the transaction analyzer.</li>
		<li>The amount and account filters are both applied if they have valid values.</li>
		<li>This is currently only deployed on the journal entry editor.</li>
		<li>The id is technically arbitrary and subject to reuse if a transaction is deleted, so don't attach any significance to one transaction vs. another.</li>
	</ol>
