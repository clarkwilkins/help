<p>Consider the following factors for setting pricing:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Is there a high demand for quotes on this item (market demand)?</li>
	<li>Are you converting a meaningful fraction of quotes? If not, do you see price reductions in the data? Do lower prices result in more orders?</li>
	<li>Where quote or order rates are lower, are you getting the sales?</li>
	<li>Have you quoted this item to this client before? Did they buy it?</li>
</ul>
