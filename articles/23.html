<p>A topic is created by a user with a title and a first comment.</p>

<p>The owner can add one or more participants at creation or later on via the discussion settings. A list of the participants in the topic is shown unless the owner sets the <tt>restricted</tt> flag.</p>

<p>The contents of a topic are considered the &#8220;thread&#8221; &#8212; one title and N >= 1 comments.</p>

<p>Comments are added by participants,<sup>1</sup> and the topic is only visible to the participants. Comments are only allowed when the topic is open.<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>When the topic is updated with a new comment, participants are updated per their account settings<sup>3</sup> &#8212; with an override by their discussion-specific settings if defined.</p>

<p>The owner can close a topic or delete the topic at their sole discretion.</p>

<div class = "block">who's on the topic and &#8220;nudging&#8221; them</div>

<p>Normally, you can click on &#8220;N members&#8221; in the top right corner and see the members of the discussion. From here, click on any other member, and you can send them a nudge &#8212; a short message and a link to this topic. It's quick way to try to trigger participants to engage in the conversation.</p>

<p>If the owner restricts the topic in discussion settings, the member list is not shown.</p>

<div class = "block">images and other uploads</div>

<p>You can add any image or other file subject to an 8 MB size limit. The files are mixed into the discussion with positioning based on when they were uploaded. On successful upload, the discussion reloads.</p>

<p>If the file is an image of type JPEG, GIF, or PNG, <tt>topical</tt> will show it inline in the discussion. Otherwise, it's only shown as a downloadable link.</p>

<p>Also, if a caption is available from the upload, it's included below the image or above the file link if the upload is not a displayable image.</p>

<div class = "block">comment editing/removal</div>

<p>Only the author/owner of a comment can update it. Click on the text of any comment you own and the editor is shown. You can update the content or clear and save to delete it.</p>
