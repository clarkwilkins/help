<p>Account numbers<sup>1</sup> are assigned as unique identifiers for your clients. The structure of the account number is completely at your discretion, but an account number can only be used once. The global customer system will prevent you from creating an account with an ID that's already in use.</p>

<p>If you need to find an available slot in your account ID sequence, use <tt>+show all</tt> in the account selection area. This presents a list of all accounts your company has recorded.</p>

<p>You can also use this list to quickly access a specific account by clicking on it.</p>
