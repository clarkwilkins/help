<div class = "block p3">delete my account and data</div>

<p>Use of this button removes all traces of your account &#8212; comments, topics, everything. It's subject to confirmation. If you just want to take a break, set your account to inactive instead.</p>

<div class = "block">active and blocked contacts</div>

<p>By default, when a contact is created, both sides get an active contact record and can invite each other to topics. If you don't want the contact to be able to invite you or to avoid having them show up on your available list, you can block them here. Clicking moves the contact from one list to the other.</p>

<div class = "block tiny">

		<li>The setting here is overridden if you configure a specific discussion. See <a href = "?h=21">discussion settings</a></li>
