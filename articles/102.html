<p>Toolkits are sets of specific inventory items grouped together as a kit.</p>

<p>To start a new kit, set a name, condition, and add the first item from inventory. If the item number is valid, the kit can be established <u>as this item</u>.<sup>1</sup> All other items in the kit will be set to <a href = "?h=58">follow it</a>, and the entire set of items will constitute the kit.</p>

<p>Upon creation, or when a kit is selected, the kit editor is shown.</p>
