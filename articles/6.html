<p class = "block">expense checks</p>

<p>When an expense is not paid from a credit card, it posts a balance due. A payment made against that balance uses an <b>expense</b> check.</p>

<p>The expense check has N >= 1 lines where each line references an expense <u>with</u> a balance and includes a payment amount against that balance.</p>

<p class = "block">liability checks</p>

<p>When paying down a liability, this is a reduction of an account balance,<sup>2</sup> <u>not</u> an expense.</p>

<p>The liability check has N >= 1 lines where each line references an account <u>with</u> a balance and includes a payment amount against that balance. This is functionally identical to a journal entry debiting one account and crediting another, but it includes additonal metadata from the check itself (and may carry an actual check number when a printed check is used).</p>
