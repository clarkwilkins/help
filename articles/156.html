<p>This test examines the connection between an applied customer credit and the payment record.<sup>1</sup> If this ID link is missing, the two cannot be correlated. Your best solution is to repost the payment.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Unlock the payment.</li>
	<li>Delete the payment.</li>
	<li>Reapply the customer credit which is now available again after step 2.</li>
</ol>

<p>This will rewrite the entire transaction and should resolve your problem.</p>
