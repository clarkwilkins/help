<p>Normally, items are constructed from existing items in inventory. To find an item, you use &#8220;search terms&#8221;. The search triggers automatically and returns any items that are a match on part name, part number/sku, or item number. Any matches found are grouped by part number and displayed along with information on how many are available and what condition they are in.</p>

<div class ="results">
	
	<div class = "flexBox reportLine">
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol1">part numbers</div>
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol3">Any item where your search string appears within the part number is included.</div>
	
	</div>
	
	<div class = "flexBox reportLine">
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol1">part names</div>
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol3">Any item where your search string appears within the part name is included.</div>
	
	</div>
	
	<div class = "flexBox reportLine">
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol1">item number</div>
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol3">If an item's unique number matches your input, it's included.</div>
	
	</div>
	
</div>

<p>If you use &#8220;search terms&#8221; and find a match, you can click on it. This causes two actions: the <tt>item description</tt> is automatically loaded with the part name and number from the clicked selection, and <a href = "?h=46">sku trend analysis</a> is performed.</p>

<p>Whether you trigger from &#8220;search terms&#8221; or not, to add an item, you must enter the <tt>item description</tt>. Optionally, you can also add <tt>rate 1</tt> and <tt>rate 2</tt>. When rate 1 is less than rate 2, this is considered an <a href = "?h=47">exchange sale</a>. If rate 1 is set equal or higher than rate 2, it's considered an <a href = "?h=47">outright sale</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Inventory analysis</strong></p>

<p>In the item description, you will also see analysis of your current stock composition. The first line shows items available to quote &#8212; divided into good and bad item counts (set by the <a href = "?h=57">item condition</a>). The second line shows where these items are located, so you can make additional decisions based on factors such as availability and whether you trust the item(s) to be available. This is discussed in more depth here.</p>
