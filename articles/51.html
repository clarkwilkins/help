<p>When adding items, <tt>stockd</tt> restricts your choices.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The item SKU must be on the original quote.</li>	
	<li>The item must be in stock.</li>	
	<li>The item must not be on this order yet.</li>	
</ul>

<p>The items shown contain details to help you choose the best item for your order. Some consideration should be given not only to <a href = "?h=149">item condition and location</a>, but also to the <tt>current value</tt>. If you're maintaining a disciplined approach to cost sources, it's prudent to sell the most &#8220;costly&#8221; item first.</p>
