<p>Pending expenses are set in the expense editor. Generally, this happens when the expense amount is set to zero, but it is possible to force the flag to <tt>true</tt> on demand.</p>

<p>The report will sort any pending expenses first by group, then date, and finally ID. From here, you have three options.</p>

<div class ="results">

	<div class = "flexBox reportLine">
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol1">move to the expense</div>
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol2">The main body of each line has basic details on the expense and acts as a clickable link to it.</div>
	
	</div>

	<div class = "flexBox reportLine">
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol1">remove the pending flag</div>
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol2"><tt>+posting</tt> will mark the expense as &#8220;posting&#8221;.</div>
	
	</div>

	<div class = "flexBox reportLine">
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol1">delete the expense</div>
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol2"><tt>-delete</tt> will remove the expense altogether.</div>
	
	</div>
	
</div>

<p>If the expense is locked, the <b>+posting</b> and <b>-delete</b> will not be available.</p>
