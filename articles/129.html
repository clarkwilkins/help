<p>Job status codes fall into one of five levels.</p>

<ol>
	<li>The ticket is has not started yet.</li>
	<li>The ticket is in progress now.</li>
	<li>The ticket is finished, but the work is not completed.</li>
	<li>The ticket is completed, and the job is done.</li>
	<li>The ticket (and possibly the job) has been cancelled.</li>
</ol>

<p>Users with administrator privileges (level 7-9) can set these status codes.</p>
