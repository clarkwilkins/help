<p>Cash position analysis helps you understand, in both a current and historical timeframe, your company's cash and assets positions.</p>

<p>Chart 1 is cash position by account. It's filtered to only show cash accounts.</p>

<p>Chart 2 is asset position by account. This includes all current and fixed asset accounts you may be using in your chart of accounts.</p>

<p>Chart 3 tracks the company cash-on-hand over time. Each date is a total of the cash you held at the end of the day.</p>

<p>Chart 4 uses the same data as chart 3 but is charting the <i>change per day</i>. If you have a net flow of cash out of the company, the chart will dip below zero.</p>

<p>Below the charts is a summary of the data in a table format:</p>
