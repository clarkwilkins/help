<p>The term &#8220;inventory composition&#8221; is used here to refer to certain qualities that individual items have &#8212; specifically the current <a href = "?h=57">item condition</a> and whether the item is in a <a href = "?h=89">controlled location</a>.</p>

<p>When quoting items, you want to consider whether (a) you have sufficient quantity in good condition, and (b) whether the items are available (accessibility) to fulfill a potential order.<p>

<p>When adding items to an order, you will want to consider item condition, accessibility, and perhaps, current inventory valuations. The last aspect requires a deeper dive into the individual items details to determine &#8220;sunk costs&#8221; &#8212; the current unrecovered capital investment/valuation of individual items that is currently on the company balance sheet as Inventory.</p>

<p>The primary decision to be made is this: can we deliver the item we are quoting or placing on an order. That is determinable by location and condition. Picking the items with the highest sunk cost is an added efficiency of process.</p>
