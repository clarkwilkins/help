<p>The transaction analyzer, by its nature, is a &#8220;power tool&#8221;. It allows you to directly manipulate transactions, but you should have a good understanding of the documentation here.</p>

<p class = "block">Transaction metadata</p>

<ul class = "smaller">

	<li>Only transactions with <u>both</u> an account <u>and</u> an amount > 0 will post.</li>

<p class = "block">Patching reconciled transactions</p>

<p>If you need to patch a reconciled transaction, try to remember the final stage of reconciliation marks all cleared transactions on the account by setting reconciled (metadata) to yes and statement date (register lines) to the closing date.</p>

<p>This way <tt>accountd</tt> can select the reconciled register lines for a specific statement as the set of transaction lines that match all three of these characteristics &#8212; the statement date being the most critical.</p>

<p>You should try to avoid changing amounts or accounts (on lines where the statement data is set) &#8212; this will break the account reconciliation.</p>

<div class = "block tiny">

	<div>NOTES</div>
	
	<ol>
	
		<li>The posting date can only be set for one value. If you have more than one reconciled line and the posting dates differ, you have to pick one. This is a good time to use the notes field.</li>
		<li>The reconciled flag prevents a related journal entry, credit card charge, payment or check from modifying the amounts or accounts involved.</li>
		<li>The transaction engine in accountd will not post an unbalanced transaction &#8212; where total debits does not equal total credits.</li>
		<li>This field is renamed if it’s in use on the transaction. In most cases, the label also changes to act as a link to the referenced item.</li>
		<li>The statement date, cleared field and reconciled field all work together. </li>
		<li>In general, these fields are relevant to bank statements (checking, loans), and credit card statements.</li>
		<li>The analyzer uses the label on pointer1 as a link to the journal entry details.</li>
		<li>The analyzer uses the label on pointer1 as a link to the payment editor.</li>
		<li>An expense check has N credits (1 per expense line) and 1 debit for the sum amount on the check.</li>
		
	</ol>
