<p>As discussed <a href = "?h=59">here</a>, there are three types of cost sources to manage. Begin by locating the source.</p>

<div class = "results">
	
	<div class = "flexBox reportLine">
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol1">search by name/item</div>
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol3">This locates sources by wild-card match in the source name or the correlated item name.<sup>1</sup></div>
	
	</div>
	
	<div class = "flexBox reportLine">
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol1">lists</div>
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol3">Alternatively, you can bring up a subset of the existing cost sources and check <tt>+details</tt> to find the correct one.</div>
	
	</div>
	
</div>

<p>Once you have the correct source, enter the editor.

<div class = "results">
	
	<div class = "flexBox reportLine">
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol1">source type</div>
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol3">You can change the source type if needed.</div>
		
	</div>
	
	<div class = "flexBox reportLine">
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol1">name</div>
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol3">This is a mandatory field.<sup>2</sup></div>
		
	</div>
	
	<div class = "flexBox reportLine">
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol1">cost</div>
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol3">A single fixed cost for the source.<sup>3</sup> If you are editing a source job or source group, there will be an additional control above labeled <tt>+cost</tt>. This allows recording multiple costs as discussed below.</div>
		
	</div>
	
	<div class = "flexBox reportLine">
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol1">linked item</div>
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol3">This is a link to the actual inventory item.<sup>4</sup></div>
		
	</div>
	
</div>

<p>If you are managing a source job or group, use <tt>+cost</tt> to add a new cost to the source, or click on an existing cost to edit it.<sup>5</sup></p>

<div class = "results">
	
	<div class = "flexBox reportLine">
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol1">amount</div>

		<div class = "flexCol flexCol1">date</div>
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol3">The cost date.</div>

</div>

<p>The total cost of the job or group is recalculated to reflect your changes.</p>

<div class = "tiny">

	<div>NOTES</div>
	
	<ol>
		<li>A name may reference multiple sources. Use <tt>+details</tt> to help find the one you want.</li>
		<li>A name that references the connected inventory item can be very helpful. &#8212; &#8220;Repair of item 1234&#8221;.</li>
		<li>In the case of a source expense, there is no further breakdown of details. It's  a 1:1 relationship between one cost and one item.</li>
		<li>Only shown on source expenses and source jobs.</li>
		<li>You can always come back and change this later if the record is not locked.</li>
