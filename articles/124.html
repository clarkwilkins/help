<p>Followups are general purpose reminders that the target item needs to be reviewed and/or acted on at a future date. When a followup becomes due, it appears on the &#9776; menu, and it turns red once it becomes overdue. The idea here is to provide a simple notification system that helps your team avoid overlooking things.</p>

<p>The followup has these components:</p>

<div class = "results">

	<div class = "flexBox reportLine">
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol1">target</div>
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol3">The item this followup is concerned with.</div>
	
	</div>

	<div class = "flexBox reportLine">
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol1">date</div>
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol3">When the followup will become active.</div>
	
	</div>
	
	<div class = "flexBox reportLine">
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol1">assigned</div>
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol3">This is an option to assign a followup to a specific user.</div>
	
	</div>
	
	<div class = "flexBox reportLine">
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol1">notes</div>
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol3">An optional field to add context on next steps, etc.</div>
	
	</div>
	
</div>

<p><tt>+assign</tt>: this shows or hides the <tt>assign followup</tt> area. If the followup has been assigned, the area is visible by default.</p>

<p><tt>+notes</tt>: this shows or hides the <tt>followup notes</tt> area. If the followup has notes, the area is visible by default.</p>

<p>Many tools provide shortcuts to clear a followup, but all followup interfaces have the <b>clear</b> function on the date picker view as well. In some cases, such as a sales quote that becomes inactive, the followup is removed automatically.</p>
