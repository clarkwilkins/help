<p>Many records have specific notes fields. There are also universal notes which are a special class that can link to an unlimited set of objects. For example, a note about a repair may want to reference the item being repaired and the repair job itself. A universal note is created once, but can be linked to many things.</p>

<p>A note can be created from the following tools:</p>

<ul>
	<li>cost sources</li>
	<li>inventory items</li>
	<li>repair jobs</li>
	<li>return records</li>
	<li>sale quotes</li>
	<li>sales orders</li>
	<li>tasks</li>
</ul>

<p>All notes originate with the switch <tt>+note</tt>. Creating a note links it to the current object.</p>

<p>To edit or delete the note, click on it.</p>

<p>To multiply link a note:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Open the note editor.</li>
	<li>Click the <b>advanced notes options</b> button.</li>
	<li>Click <tt>+link</tt>.</li>
	<li>Select a link type.</li>
	<li>Run a search and find the item you want to connect.</li>
	<li>Click on the item and it's immediately connected.</li>
</ol>

<p>To unlink a note from an item:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Open the note editor.</li>
	<li>Click the <b>advanced notes options</b> button.</li>
