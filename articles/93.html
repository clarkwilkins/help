<p>Notes search is a simple wild-card, case-insensitive search on the content of your notes. For example, entering &#8220;test&#8221; will find every note where <b>test</b> appears.</p>

<p>You can use <tt>restrict to this type</tt> to narrow the scope of the search to notes connected to a particular item type.</p>

<p>The results will include the notes content in full, and all items linked to the note.</p>
