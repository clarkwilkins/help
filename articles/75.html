		<li>Vendors are global entities, managed separately. If the vendor is not connected to this company at present, it's indicated with a *.</li>
		<li>The new vendor must have a unique name to your group, or the existing one will be substituted. When a new vendor is created, it's automatically linked to this company, but can be made accessible to other platforms or companies as desired.</li>
