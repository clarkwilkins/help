<p><tt>stockd</tt> can generate followups automatically by signaling to the Simplexable global API. The basic mechanism is set in company setup, and, from that point, becomes fully automatic.</p>

<div class = "block"><strong>setting followups for new sales quotes</strong></div>

<ol>
	<li>Go to <strong>&#9776; > other tools > setup (company preferences)</strong></li>
	<li>Set <tt>new quotes set a followup in X days</tt> to a value of 1 or more.</li>
</ol>

<p>The setting is saved automatically. From this point, every new quote will have a followup set automatically for (step 2) business days from today.</p>
