<p>The interface to <strong>healthica</strong> needs your group ID and user ID to work. You can enter them here, so they are stored in your user record. Once this is done, you will be able to post information directly into the <strong>healthica</strong> platform without switching applications.</p>

<p>Whenever you loads this page, <strong>stockd</strong> makes a test query to <strong>healthica</strong>. If this is successful, you will see the following on the page:</p>

<blockquote>&#128578 Your healthica settings were just validated. You're ready to go!</blockquote>

<p>This enables bridging functions like automatically filing your parts requests on your <strong>healthica</strong> account.</p>
