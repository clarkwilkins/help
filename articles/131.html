<p>The document manager will let you connect any document up to 8 MB in size to the job. Use <tt>+new</tt> to invoke a new upload.</p>

<p><strong>servicd</strong> currently supports two kinds of document linking: linking to a specific job ticket or linking to the entire job. The difference is that a specific link only shows up on the linked job ticket, while a general link shows up on every ticket, and also on the metadata page.</p>

<p>To generate a document link, use <tt>+new</tt> in the documents section. Add the document and a caption and it’s linked on upload. If you link from a specific job, that’s the link that’s used. If you link from the metadata via <tt>+info</tt>, it’s linked to everything in the job ticket and information views.</p>

<p>Unlinking and searching are covered in the general documents section.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT: When you link anything to a service ticket and leave the public flag set to “yes”, the document will appear on the PDFs you generate.</p>
