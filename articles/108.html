<p>Simplexable operates three primary platforms that support &#8220;global users&#8221;.</p>

<div class = "results">

	<div class = "flexBox reportLine">
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol1"><b>accountd</b></div>
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol3">Full accounting services and financial analysis with ability to manage multiple companies in a single application/login.</div>
	
	</div>

	<div class = "flexBox reportLine">
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol1"><b>servicd</b></div>
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol3">Service and job management.</div>
	
	</div>

	<div class = "flexBox reportLine">
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol1"><b>stockd</b></div>
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol3">Inventory, warehouse, and parts sales management.</div>
	
	</div>

</div>

<p>A global user can access any of the platforms as configured in their settings.</p>

<p>Once Simplexable assigns you a new company ID with <b>pro</b> access, you can begin with one platform, and add the others at will. Login is a single event &#8212; one login for access to all allowed areas.</p>

<p>When you make a platform on company X available to a user, it adds to the list of environments where they can work. Each user/company/platform is a unique set of access privileges, but the user is able to move from one to another at will using the &#9776; menu option <tt>switch platforms</tt>.</p>
