<p>Followups are an organizational/quasi-reminder system that you use to set a date when you need to look at something &#8212; to follow up on it. For example, <tt>stockd</tt> automatically creates a followup for the next day whenever you quote a client. Another example is sending an item to repair, and setting a followup to check on it 14 days later.</p>

<p>Followups can be set on:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Sales quotes</li>	
	<li>Sales orders</li>	
	<li>Returns records</li>	
	<li>Repair jobs</li>	
	<li>Inventory items</li>	
	<li>Tasks</li>	
</ul>

<p>There are two components: the followup date, and an optional assignment linking responsibility to a specific user.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>Followups are always set from a date control labelled <tt>followup</tt> on the item.</p>

<p>Followups appear on the &#9776; menu when they come due, and they turn red from the next day until they are cleared. Clearing is done from the list (<tt>-clear</tt>) or from the item &#8212; clearing the followup date by clicking on it and accessing the date handler_.</p>
