<p>The job report is a single view with all tickets on the job. The sections are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Customer name, po, and address</li>
	<li>All tickets in the order they were booked</li>
	<li>Billable hours if any</li>
	<li>Public-accessible documents, if any<sup>1</sup></li>
</ul>

<p>This is all combined into a single PDF which you can print and/or email. You can generate a job report from the edit ticket or billing views.</p>

		<li>The public flag is set on the document record. By default, itâ€™s set to yes, but can be toggled to keep any document private to your users (and not the customer).</li>
