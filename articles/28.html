<p>This analysis is based on the aggregate spend per category per month. This is accrual-basis analysis &#8212; no distinction is made on whether an expense has been paid or not. There are two views which consider this data from different perspectives.</p>

<div class = "block">expense breakdown</div>

<p>The view is a series of pie-charts, one per month, for the selected year. The slices are sorted by spend amount and displayed as a total with categories with the highest spend in the month shown first.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>For further detail, click on any chart to toggle a complete breakdown of the data with subtotals and percentage of total expense in the month.</p>

<p>You can go even further by clicking on a row in the results table to switch to advanced expense search and see all of the expenses in the subtotal.</p>

<div class = "block">cost trends</div>

<p>The view shows all expenses that reach a threshold of <u>at least</u> 2.5% during any one month period in the year. The values shown are scaled as a percentage of the entire expenses in the month. For example, if you have $5000.00 in total costs in January and the rent is $2000.00, the rent line will be at 40% for that month.</p>

		<li>Expense categories that account for < 2.5% of the monthly total are combined into an &#8220;Other&#8221; category. The actual percentage is a bit erratic at the time this article was written &#8212; seems to be hit or miss on displaying a value due to something in Google Charts.</li>
		<li>Both of these tools are available in the analysis options.</li>
