<p>On the login screen, you are presented two options.</p>

<p>The easiest method is to enter your registered email address or mobile phone number. The system will look up your user record and send you an email with one (or more)<sup>1</sup> login links. These links are single-click logins which have embedded authorization and do not require additional login actions.</p>

<p>Your second option requires your account to already have a username and password defined. In this case, you can enter these parameters, and, upon verification, you are logged into the software. If you choose to create this login, it's a very good idea to avoid common passwords for your own security. You might also take a look <a href = "?h=106">here</a> for a method of dramatically increasing your security.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, errors do happen sometimes. The following is a list of problems this module detects, and solutions advice.</p>

		<li>We support the capability to not only access more than one of our platforms from a single login, but also run the same services as more than one company.</li>
		<li>Simplexable support will only reset this if we are asked by an authorized representative of your company. It's faster if you just go to your administrator.</li>
		<li>These errors are internal breakpoints we would use to troubleshoot the interactivity between various Simplexable services. Hopefully, you never see these errors, but if you do, the only thing to do is make sure we know via support@simplexable.com.</li>
