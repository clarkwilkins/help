<p>Parts requests are used to record market requests. They track who's asking for what, and whether you have it for sale. As such, they provide an invaluable historical perspective on market conditions.</p>

<p>To create a parts request:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Access the tool from the &#9776; menu.</li>
	<li>Select the customer who's making the request.<sup>1</sup></li>
	<li>Enter the part number or name,<sup>2</sup> and wait for the stock check to run.<sup>3</sup></li>
	<li>Click on the part name if it came up in step 3, or add the part name if necessary.<sup>4</sup></li>
	<li>Select a request status.</li>
	<li>Add notes if desired.</li>
	<li>Save the request.</li>
</ol>

<div class = "sectionTitle">Interfacing with healthica</div>

<p>If you have set up an account on <a href = "https://healthica.com" target = "_blank">healthica.com</a> and set up your credentials as discussed <a href = "?a=141">here</a>, additional options will be shown that can load your parts request onto <strong>healthica</strong> as well. When using this option, your request is immediately distributed on the <strong>healthica</strong> network, and you <u>do not</u> need to file a separate request there.<sup>5</sup></p>

	<ol>
		<li>Use <tt>+new client</tt> to create the customer first, if necessary, and then return here.</li>
		<li>This search is flexible. You can use a whole or partial SKU or part name. In either case, the search will include all potential matches.</li>
		<li>This is a quick check to see if you have it in stock. If so, <strong>STOP</strong> and switch to quoting it. Sales quotes will automatically file parts requests for all items on the quote.</li>
		<li>If the part name is already in the standard parts names table, it will show up here whether you have ever had one in stock or not.</li>
		<li>Your request will be found in <strong>&#9776;:my requests</strong> as normal.</li>
		<li>You can make changes on healthica under &#8220;my interests&#8221;.</li>
		<li>By design, any change to the part name overwrites this field. You want to change this after you are done with the part name.</li>
