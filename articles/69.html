<p>Parts requests are used to record market requests. They track who's asking for what, and whether you have it for sale. As such, they provide an invaluable historical perspective on market conditions.</p>

<p>To create a parts request:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Access the tool from the &#9776; menu.</li>
	<li>Select the customer who's making the request.<sup>1</sup></li>
	<li>Enter the part number and wait for the stock check to run.<sup>2</sup></li>
	<li>Click on the part name if it came up in step 3, or add the part name if necessary.<sup>3</sup></li>
	<li>Select a request status.</li>
	<li>Add notes if desired.</li>
	<li>Save the request.</li>
</ol>

	<ol>
		<li>Use <tt>+new client</tt> to create the customer first, if necessary, and then return here.</li>
		<li>This is a quick check to see if you have it in stock. If so, <b>STOP</b> and switch to quoting it. Sales quotes will automatically file parts requests for all items on the quote.</li>
		<li>If the part name is already in the standard parts names table, it will show up here whether you have ever had one in stock or not.</li>
