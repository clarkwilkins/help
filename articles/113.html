<p>The Simplexable login service has two methods of login: direct and username/password.</p>

<p>Direct login links are obtained by entering your registered email or phone number. If a match is found, you are sent an email with a direct login link. We recommend bookmarking this somewhere safe for your convenience.</p>

<p>To use a username/password login, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Go to preferences via &#9776;: other tools: setup (personal preferences)</li>
	<li>In <b>new login</b>, enter a new username and password.</li>
	<li>Click the save button.</li>
</ol>

<p>Your login information is encrypted and saved.<sup>1</sup> There's an easy recovery path if you forget it though.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Use your registered email or phone to get a login link emailed to you.</li>
	<li>Login via the direct link from step 1.</li>
	<li>Update your username/password with the procedure above.</li>
</ol>
