		<li>All clients are accessible within a company ID (<tt>servicd</tt>, <tt>stockd</tt>) or an entities group (<tt>accountd</tt>) if this is checked. However, a user with access to manage clients can still see these groups within customer management, because this tool exists above the individual platforms.</li>
		<li>Tags are intended for a future expansion of capabilities, but you can start using them now.</li>
		<li>These fields are only shown on locations that have already been created.</li>
