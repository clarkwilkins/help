<p>The settings here are maintained across all Simplexable platforms available to you. Many input fields are automatically triggered by your input. The delays set here are the time (in seconds) from your last keypress until the relevant action is triggered.</p>

<p><b>delay 1</b> generally takes hold on larger screens such as laptops and PCs. If this is your work environment, you may want to set this for a snappy response time of 1 second.</p>

<p><b>delay 2</b> generally takes hold on smaller screens such as smartphones. If this is your work environment, you may want to set this for a longer time to allow for the speed you can use the touch-based &#8220;keyboard&#8221;. Our recommendation is 2.5 seconds.</p>
