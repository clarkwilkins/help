<p>This tool is used for batch verification of inventory</p>

<ol>
	<li>Go to the physical location.</li>
	<li>Open the location contents in this tool.</li>
	<li>Strongly recommended: remove all items from the location temporarily.</li>
	<li>Click on each item as you put it back. This marks the item as verified today, by you.</li>
	<li>Attend to any missing items or items that were expected. (See below.)
</ol>

<p>Missing items are best marked as lost and not ok to sell.</p>

<p>Misplaced items should either be returned to their proper location and verified, or have their location updated to current status.</p>
