<p>Notifications are best understood as a note linked to a specific item and targeted to a specific user. A notification differs from a general note in  several ways:</p>

<div class = "results">

	<div class = " reportLine 2 flexBox">
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol1"><strong>notification</strong></div>
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol1"><strong>general note</strong></div>
	
	</div>

	<div class = " reportLine 2 flexBox">
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol1">Only links to one data object.</div>
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol1">Can link to an unlimited number of data objects.</div>
	
	</div>

	<div class = " reportLine 2 flexBox">
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol1">Targeted to a single user with option to notify them by email, SMS, or website only.</div>
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol1">No direct notification of a user is available.</div>
	
	</div>

	<div class = " reportLine 2 flexBox">
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol1">The target user can acknowledge the notification and add a reply.</div>
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol1">Any user can add a followup note, but there is no direct linkage.</div>
	
	</div>

	<div class = " reportLine 2 flexBox">
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol1">Visible on all platforms the target user can access (stockd, servicd, etc...).</div>
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol1">Only visible on the connected item(s) in a single platform.</div>
	
	</div>

</div>

<p><strong>Creating a notification</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>In the target item, click <tt>+new</tt> in the notifications section.</li>
	<li>Select your target user.</li>
	<li>Enter the notification text. The first line becomes the subject. Any following lines become the comments.</li>
	<li>Select an alert method if you want the target user to receive an email or SMS. In any case, the notification icon on the top menu will indicate an active statusas shown below.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Accessing the notifications manager</strong></p>


<p>You can access your notifications by clicking on the manager icon on the top menu, right side. The icon has two states:</p>

<p><img src = "https://helpd.simplexable.com/images/active-notifications.png" /> one or more active notifications: . In this state, the manager will show all notifications which are active (including acknowledged items).<sup>1, 2</sup></p>

<p><img src = "https://helpd.simplexable.com/images/check-notifications.png" /> no active notifications:  In this state, the manager is accessible, but will not show anything.</p>

<p><strong>Clearing notifications</strong></p>

<p>The guiding principle here should be to <u>not</u> clear a notification if it includes a &#8220;call to action&#8221; that has not been accomplished. For this reason, the state &#8220;acknowledged, remains open&#8221; can be used to indicate this has been seen, but remains active.</p>

<p>The targeted user can also &#8220;respond&#8221; to the originator with a comment that becomes part of the public record. Comments can only be made or updated by the target user.</p>

<div class = "tiny">

	<div>NOTES</div>
	
	<ol>
	
		<li>Once a notification has been closed, it will no longer be accessible here, but does remain permanently connected to the targeted item.</li>
		<li>When a notification is &#8220;acknowledged, remains open&#8221; it indicates the targeted user has seen it, but does not want to close it out yet.</li>

	</ol>
	
</div>
