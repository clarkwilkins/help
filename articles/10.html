<p>Trial balance is a standard accounting report listing the total transactons in all debits and accounts for the entity. Since, <b>accountd</b> is designed to accomodate multiple entities in a single system, you can run this report on each one as needed.</p>

<p>The definitions of <b>debit</b> and <b>credit</b> differ here from what you see internally to a transaction.</p>

<p>debits: assets, expenses</p>
	
<p>credits: liabilities, equity, revenue</p>

<p>It's <u>quite</u> possible to see negative values here. The report is a net change in the account over the period. If you draw out more from &#8220;Cash&#8221; then you put in over the selected period, that negative number will be reported.</p>

<div class = "block">Since the internal transaction engine <u>cannot</u> post an unbalanced transaction, this report is considered of little use other than possibly looking for misapplication of funds.</div>
