		<li>Making a change on part number or part name change the part name for every request using this part number. This is done to make the request data consistent when a (hopefully) better part name is found. This data is not considered trusted enough to change actual inventory items. You have to go to an item in the inventory with the part number and change it there to affect inventory SKU:name pairs.</li>
