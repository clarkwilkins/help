<p>This analysis simply compares what the selected entity billed in the period against what it expensed. No account is taken here for actual receipts or payments, as that's the role of cash position analysis.<sup>1</sup> The analysis also accounts for categorized journal entries.<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>The chart aggregates by month, but is bound by the starting and ending dates in setup. Any month which has no income data is set to zero. The same applies on the expense line. <tt>net = billed - expenses</tt> which is why the green line can go negative.</p>
