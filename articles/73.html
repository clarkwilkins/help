<p><tt>examine returns</tt> looks for a specific situation where a return record should normally exist.</p>

<ul>
	<li>An item is on an order.</li>
	<li>Rate 2 > rate 1 indicates an exchange sale.</li>
	<li>There is no return record present.</li>
</ul>

<p>Normally, this would appear to be an anomaly which is correctable. Either, we generate a return record, or we set the two quoted rates to the same amount.</p>

<p>However, if neither of these is desirable, <tt>-bypass</tt> will allow the report to skip over the return, though it will be noted as a bypassed item.</p>
