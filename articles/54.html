<p>When selling items <a href = "?h=47">on exchange</a>, it becomes critical to track the expected returns. <tt>stockd</tt> does this with &#8220;return records&#8221; which track the process.</p>

<div class = "results">
	
	<div class = "flexBox reportLine">

<p>You can also send return notices from this tool. The notices are pre-formatted by <tt>stockd</tt> and available for <tt>+email</tt> (send as attachment with custom text in the email message), snf <tt>+pdf</tt> (generate a PDF for use).</p>

<p>Notes are added and edited with the standard interface. It's good practice to link the notes to the exchange and/or original items as well.</p>

	<ol>
		<li>If more than one item is sold on <a href = "?h=47">exchange basis</a> on an order, a separate return record is generated for each item, but they will all link back to the same originating order.</li>
		<li>The default number of days allowed for the exchange window is set in <b>other tools: setup</b>.</li>
		<li>The default set here is the first available item number.</li>
		<li>Usually, this is the same as the original item, so it's set by default.</li>
