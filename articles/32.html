<p>All users can set a preferred background color to be associate with their comments. To make a selection, go to &#8220;current&#8221;, then access your settings via &#9776; on the top right corner.</p>

<p>Click on the color block above &#8220;preferred color&#8221; and make your choice from the palette. Your new color is saved immediately.</p>

<p>Within the discussion, colors are assigned as follows:</p>

<ol>
	<li>If you have a color preference, you <u>alway</u> get the color reservation by default in your own view of the discussion.</li>
	<li><tt>topical</tt> goes through the comments in order and checks if the author has a color preference.</li>
	<li>If a preference is found, and has <u>not</u> been reserved by a prior commenter, this user gets the color they prefer.</li>
	<li>After all preferences have been fulfilled (where there is no conflict in step 3), all users in the discussion who do not have an assignment get one now as the first available color in the palette.</li>
</ol>

<p>If two users in a discussion have both reserved <span style = "color: #CCCCFF">this color</span>, the assignment works like this:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Each user sees their own comments as <span style = "color: #CCCCFF">this color</span> when they are viewing the discussion from their own account.</li>
	<li>Any other user sees <span style = "color: #CCCCFF">this color</span> assigned to the first of the two above who makes a comment in the discussion. The second user's comments will receive a semi-random color assignment from the unreserved colors that remain.</li>
</ul>
