<p>These graphs are derived directly from expense data and are <u>not</u> looking at actual cash transfers.<sup>1</sup> They plot amounts as entered and use the initial expense dates.<sup>2</sup> The controls select an entity, an optional start and end date<sup>3</sup>, and an option to display a single expense type.</p>

<div class = "block"><b>monthly expenses</b></div>

<p>The expenses are grouped according to the posting account and separated. All expenses indicated to post to a Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) are shown on the blue line. All other expense are shown on the red line. The orange line is the total of both.</p>

<div class = "block"><b>daily expenses</b></div>

<p>The expenses are summed together regardless of posting account and displayed as a daily total. By it's nature, this sort of graph is noisy, so we use it primarily to decide on dates of interest where we will investigate further.</p>

<div class = "block"><b>category charts</b></div>
