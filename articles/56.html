<p>Each inventory item is a unique record in the system with an internal ID and the item number you normally reference it by. <tt>stockd</tt> is primarily intended to manage discrete items, but there is a separate system that handles manufacturing inputs (consumables).</p>

<p>The <b>internal use</b> section is an optional way to aggregate a collection of N items onto an <a href = "?h=88">internal job</a> (not an order). This feature is experimental and not fully developed at this time.</p>

<p>The <b>connections</b> section will show any orders, return records, or repair jobs this item has been linked to.</p>

<p>The <b>documents</b> section allows you to link new documents or photos to the item. Documents can be multiply linked to a number of other data types in <tt>stockd.</tt></p>
