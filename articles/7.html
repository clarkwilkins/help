<p>The <b>chart of accounts</b> shows current register values for all accounts. When you have more than one company (aka &#8220;entity&#8221;), each COA is shown independently.</p>

<p>The view has three columns:</p>

<div class ="results">

	<div class = "flexBox reportLine">
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol1">account number</div>
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol3">This is a link to the account editor tool.</div>
	
	</div>

	<div class = "flexBox reportLine">
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol1">account name</div>
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol3">This is a link to the account register.</div>
	
	</div>

	<div class = "flexBox reportLine">
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol1">current balance</div>
	
		<div class = "flexCol flexCol3">This is a link to the account register.</div>
	
	</div>
