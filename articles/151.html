<p>Each entity needs an <strong>Adjustments and Refunds</strong> account<sup>1</sup> to be able to process credit memos. When a credit memo is created, it results in a journal entry from the relevant Sales Income account to this one.<sup>2</sup> For this reason, the account is required before you begin using credit memos.</p>

<p>Follow these steps:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Go to <strong>&#9776; chart of accounts</strong>.</li>
	<li>Click on <tt>+new</tt> in the entity/company that needs this account.</li>
	<li>Create the account<sup>1</sup> with type <strong>Income</strong>.</li>
	<li>Go to <strong>&#9776; tools</strong> and select the option <strong>special accounts</strong>.</li>
	<li>Select this entity if necessary, and then set <strong>adjustments and refunds account</strong> to your new account.</li>
</ul>

<p>After completing these steps, your credit memo function should operate properly.</p>
