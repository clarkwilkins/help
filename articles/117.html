<ul>

	<li>Sending part to repair vendor</li>
	<li>Requesting status of repair</li>
	<li>Requesting billing information</li>
	<li>Modification of repair request/terms</li>
	<li>Requesting shipment of item(s)</li>
	<li>Requesting documentation</li>
	<li>Cancelling repair</li>
	
</ul>

<p>The email text is provided as a template which is completely modifiable in each email.<sup>1</sup> The mail message will automatically include a PDF of the repair order for the recipients' reference. There are multiple other fields which change their labeling depending on the notice type.</p>
